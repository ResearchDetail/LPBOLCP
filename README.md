# LPBOLCP

LPBOLCP is short for the paper's name "*Link Prediction Based on Local Community Properties*".

## CodeForPaper.py

The code for the paper is written in *Python*.

We use *MongoDB* as database for storing the original data of networks.

## Simulation Images

We also upload our simulation images for clarity. 

The name of images is composed of "name of network", "time of simulation", and "times of repeat" by "_" separator. 

For example, "Zebra_20151223103622_1000t.png" means that our code runs 1000 times on the Zebra network at 2015/12/23 10:36:22.
